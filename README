About tizen-distro
==================

tizen-distro is a combination of several different components in a
single repository:
- bitbake
- openembedded-core
- meta-openembedded
- meta-qt5
- meta-tizen

The top-level directory comes from openembedded-core, everything else
is in its own sub-directory. tizen-distro gets updated by copying
importing patches from the component's repostories. Please submit
patches against those instead of tizen-distro.

Updating tizen-distro
=====================

Everyone with a copy of the tizen-distro repository can use
scripts/combo-layer to import patches from the components. That works
because the "last_revision" property which gets changed after each
import gets committed to the combined repostory.

First, copy conf/combo-layer-local-sample.conf into
conf/combo-layer-local.conf and set the paths for each component
repository to a suitable location.

Then run:
- "scripts/combo-layer init" (only once)
- "scripts/combo-layer update <component>" where <component> is either one of
  components above (for updating just that one) or empty (for updating all)

Branching tizen-distro
======================

Each branch in tizen-distro tracks one branch in each component. To
create a new branch:
- checkout a new branch in tizen-component
- change the "branch" properties in conf/combo-layer.conf
- change the branch part in the last_revision sections
- commit
- continue as before

This works best if the last imported revision from each component is
the branching point of that component. Ensure that by updating before
the components branch. If it is too late, either select patches
interactively or import too many patches and then drop unwanted ones
via "git rebase" or "git reset --hard". Remember to keep
"last_revision" correct when doing that.
